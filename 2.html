            <h1>Earliest conceptions of the universe</h1>
<p>
    All scientific thinking on the nature of the universe can be traced to the distinctive 
    geometric patterns formed by the stars in the night sky. Even prehistoric people must
     have noticed that, apart from a daily rotation (which is now understood to arise from 
     the spin of Earth), the stars did not seem to move with respect to one another: the stars 
     appear “fixed.” Early nomads found that knowledge of the constellations could guide their 
     travels, and they developed stories to help them remember the relative positions of the s
     tars in the night sky. These stories became the mythical tales that are part of most cultures.
<br>When nomads turned to farming, an intimate knowledge of the constellations served a new 
function—an aid in timekeeping, in particular for keeping track of the seasons. People had 
noticed very early that certain celestial objects did not remain stationary relative to the 
“fixed” stars; instead, during the course of a year, they moved forward and backward in a
 narrow strip of the sky that contained 12 constellations constituting the signs of the zodiac. 
 Seven such wanderers were known to the ancients: the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, 
 Jupiter, and Saturn. Foremost among the wanderers was the Sun: day and night came with its 
 rising and setting, and its motion through the zodiac signaled the season to plant and the 
 season to reap. Next in importance was the Moon: its position correlated with the tides, and 
 its shape changed intriguingly over the course of a month. The Sun and Moon had the power of 
 gods; why not then the other wanderers? Thus probably arose the astrological belief that the 
 positions of the planets (from the Greek word planetes, “wanderers”) in the zodiac could 
 influence worldly events and even cause the rise and fall of kings. In homage to this belief, 
 Babylonian priests devised the week of seven days, whose names even in various modern 
 languages (for example, English, French, or Norwegian) can still easily be traced to their 
 origins in the seven planet-gods.</p>
