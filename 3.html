        <h1>Astronomical theories of the ancient Greeks</h1>
 <p>
    The apex in the description of planetary motions during classical antiquity was reached
     with the Greeks, who were of course superb geometers. Like their predecessors, Greek 
     astronomers adopted the natural picture, from the point of view of an observer on Earth, 
     that Earth lay motionless at the centre of a rigidly rotating celestial sphere (to which 
     the stars were “fixed”), and that the complex to-and-fro wanderings of the planets in the 
     zodiac were to be described against this unchanging backdrop. They developed an epicyclic 
     model that would reproduce the observed planetary motions with quite astonishing accuracy. 
     The model invoked small circles on top of large circles, all rotating at individual uniform 
     speeds, and it culminated about 140 CE with the work of Ptolemy, who introduced the ingenious
     artifact of displaced centres for the circles to improve the empirical fit. Although the model 
     was purely kinematic and did not attempt to address the dynamical reasons for why the motions 
     were as they were, it laid the groundwork for the paradigm that nature is not capricious but 
     possesses a regularity and precision that can be discovered from experience and used to predict 
     future events.</p>
